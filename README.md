# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project demonstrates my ability to work with datasets by performing **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization**.  
It is designed as part of my portfolio for a **Research Assistant (RA) position**.

## Project Structure
- `data/` → contains the dataset (CSV format)
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebook with detailed analysis
- `main.py` → script for running the analysis quickly
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RA-Sample-EDA-Project.git
   cd RA-Sample-EDA-Project
